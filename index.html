                        <p class="card-text">In 2023, we embarked on an epic road trip from Kansas City to Denver, dubbing it 'The Year of the Bus.' Our trusty 15-passenger bus became our home on wheels as we journeyed to the Mile High City. Some of us flew in, converging at our best AirBnb yet, setting the stage for a golfing adventure unlike any other.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">This year, we focused on celebrating the artistry of golf course architecture, immersing ourselves in the history and design of each course we played.</p>

And of course, there were moments of laughter and camaraderie – like the time we accidentally almost walked off with someone's golf clubs!

                    <p class="card-text">But Texas had a curveball for us - a blast of Kansas cold greeted our arrival. Yet, undeterred, we braved the 40-degree rain and hit the course with gusto.
